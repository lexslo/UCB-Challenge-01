# Horiseon Refactor

Both the HTML and CSS for Horiseon's landing page have been cleaned up and assessed for accessibility and organization.

## Objective

A marketing agency wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
The webpage meets accessibility standards when: 
- The source code contains semantic HTML elements
- The structure of the HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- The image elements contain accessible alt attributes
- The heading attributes fall in sequential order
- The title element contains a concise, descriptive title
